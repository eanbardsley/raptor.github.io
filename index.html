<p> Certain drama unfolded in the course of my research into the realm artificial intelligence (AI) that resulted in several leads in the area of the extraterrestrial mystery. In order to see its full significance, it is useful to have a knowledge of the ancient history of humans and their origins. That is, to be familiar with Sumer, Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, and the origins of Shamanism and Religion.</p>

<p>I don’t consider myself to have discovered this as much as to have received it. I consider myself, then, to be in Receivership. In this version of my presentation of The ET Discovery, I give a brief outline of the basic human history in a few pages to the best of my ability in a subject field where my working knowledge is less adept.</p>

<p> Since 200,000 years ago, anatomical modern humans (homo sapiens) have existed on earth and, since their beginning, has been crafting tools out of stone. It would seem, overnight, they all of the sudden expanded their stone craft to making not just tools for hunting, but to make stone altars for the first form of worship.  It would also seem they they began painting on cave walls.  Aside from painting the animals they hunted they painted, whether in Africa or Europe, a figure in common, that paleontologists call “The Wounded Man”. It is a man with spears stuck in himself.  It was finally suggested that this was not a man who was attacked, but a tribal leader and medicine man responsible for the cave paintings themselves, a Shaman. That he is wounded suggests that he may have eaten hallucinogenic plants, such as the Iboga, and painted himself wounded because eating hallucinogens makes one’s skin tingle, or have the sensation they are being pricked with spines. This, was the first form of religion, known as Shamanism, which today is still practiced by tribes from Africa to the New World.</p>

<p>Similarly, overnight, once again comes the second transformation: Humans stop wandering and gathering, and settle down to build homes, grow their food, raise animals for eating, building homes, schools, developing writing and mathematics—civilization in other words. This advancement takes place in Mesopotamia (The Middle East) but not by the Amorites, Akkadians, and Assyrians who existed there, but by a people whose existence was discovered beneath the ruins of the latter, the Sumerians of Sumer.</p>

<p>It would seem when scholars read the Assyrian language, they found it was based upon another language, which suggested there were a people in Mesopotamia that preceded them. So they dug deeper and found another culture beneath them, who started civilization, The Sumerians.</p>

<p>Unearthed were cuneiform tablets of the first human writing, characters printed on clay tablets that measured 17 by 22 centimeters. The first discovery of cuneiform tablets was in the fifteenth century in the ruins of Persepolis, in Persia, the ancient capitol of King Darius I. They portrayed an understanding that the Earth was round, and a science of Astronomy that was beyond that around the time just before Copernicus, who first had the revelation that the Earth was not at the center of the Universe, but orbited the Sun. These Sumerians, it would seem, were the first to settle down and go from hunting to farming, and being the first to invent agriculture, about 12,000 BC.</p>

<p> What we have is that civilization first appears simultaneously and separately (as well as independently) in Mesopotamia and Egypt.  In the case of Mesopotamia, it was invaded many times, and it invaded surrounding areas as well, but in Egypt they arose uninfluenced because they were never invaded because of their geographic isolation due to being surrounded by desert to the North and West, by ocean to the East, and by forest to the South.</p>

<p>The nature of the civilizations were also different due to their respective differences in environment.  Mesopotamia fired clay to make bricks for making their homes (being in a desert) where Egypt used wood because of an abundance of trees.</p>

<p>Today there is a great mystique surrounding Egypt and the Middle East (Mesopotamia)  regarding their possible ancient connections to extraterrestrials. Religion is suggested by Zecharia Sitchin to have been brought by this ancient connection with ETs to India and Greece by way of The Hurrians.</p>

<p>It is explained thusly by Sitchin: Greek Gods and Hindu Gods both come from Asia Minor.  A People went East to India bringing the Vedas, and West to Greece bringing the Olympian Gods, both rooted in 12 seats. They were the Hittites whose abode was Anatolia. Their culture, however, was rooted in Sumeria by way of the Hurrians, mentioned in the Old Testament (Horites). They dominated a wide area from Sumer to Anatolia.</p>

<p>Wikipedia says: Anatolia, also known as Asia Minor, Asian Turkey, the Anatolian peninsula, or the Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey.</p>

<p> It would seem the Italian explorer Columbus, who had access to Ancient Greek literature, understood that the world was not flat, but round.  Knowing this, he suggested to the Queen Isabella of Spain, that a westerly route to India was possible and, as such, she should fund him to attempt such a voyage. Which she did. Little did he know, there was a landmass between India and Europe in the Atlantic.  As such, believing he arrived in India, when in reality he arrived in The New World, he named the Native Americans, Indians, and that is how they got their name.</p>

<p>Little did he know, by spreading Christianity to the New World, that when the Natives would assimilate it into their beliefs, it would result in a system of religion that was another manifestation of Hinduism of the actual India, as can be seen in these two photographs of Indian and Native American shrines:</p>

<p> But what is this supposed connection that Mesopotamia and Egypt might have had with extraterrestrials? In Sumer of Mesopotamia, the first people stopped following the herds and hunting, settled down, made homes, and began farming. In doing such they invented writing, schools, government, mathematics,… and the mystery is that they did this almost overnight, so it is suggested that extraterrestrials gave them this knowledge. Indeed their records say a people came from above and left two of theirs behind as their overlords, Enki and Enlil, the Anunnaki brothers from a planet called Nibiru. The full account can be found in The Twelfth Planet by Zecharia Sitchin, who was one of the first to read the Sumerian language, who put forward the theory.<p/>

<p>But what of Egypt? The Pyramids of Ancient Egypt are made of huge stone blocks that weigh hundreds if not thousands of tons. They were somehow brought from a quarry hundreds of miles away, were cut to precise dimensions, and stacked into pyramids which satisfy natural mathematical constants. How did they do this? Maurice Chatelain, the NASA scientist that oversaw the construction of the communications systems for the Apollo missions to the moon writes in his book Our Cosmic Ancestors, that extraterrestrials had to have helped to build these pyramids and because they are polished and thus reflective, were made for the ETs as landing beacons. That is they are surfaces upon which their ships could send a signal to and get a reflection back to let them know their position. </p>

<p> Akkadian, the oldest Semitic language, was the language of Mesopotamia (Akkad, Assyria, and Babylonia) and is now extinct. It was spoken from the 30th century BC, until its gradual replacement by Aramaic, between the 8th century BC and its final extinction by the first to third centuries AD. It used the cuneiform writing system of the unrelated Sumerian, which is a language isolate.  That is to say, that Sumerian is related to no other language and, has no ancestors, because it would seem it was an original language that sprung up on its own and, seems to be the first written language, as the Sumerians of Sumer were the first to settle down from wandering and gathering and build homes and start doing agriculture instead of hunting. That is to say, they seem to have invented civilization. 

By the second millennium BC, two variant forms of Akkadian were in use in Assyria and Babylonia, known as Assyrian and Babylonian. It declined around the 8th century BC, being marginalized by Aramaic. Aramaic gradually replaced Hebrew, which was spoken by the Jews. Aramaic was itself supplanted by Arabic in the 7th century AD. There exist tablets with translations between Sumerian and Akkadian, and, it would seem there was a time when Sumerians and Akkadian spoke one another’s language.

The language that Jesus would have spoke was Aramaic, that was the language of the Jews at the time in that region. His name, Yeshua, is Aramaic. Jesus would have been a rabbi (teacher) that broke with traditional views.

The New Testament was written in Greek, which was the common language of the Eastern Mediterranean at the time. The first three testaments of the New Testament were written AD 50 to AD 70 and John’s between AD 80 and AD 90. That is, 20 to 40 years after the death of Christ (AD 30 to AD 33). The full name of of Jesus was Yeshua Ben Yosef (Yeshua Son of Joseph).

God in Hebrew is Elohim. God’s name is Yud He Vuv He, the Hebrew letters for his name without the vowels. Many insert the vowels a and e so the his name becomes YAHWEH. But as they did not say the name of God, every time they came across it in the Torah, they said Adonoi, meaning lord. The name of of God in Yiddish is Hashem. Since Adonoi the lord became mis-spelled, it evolved into Jehovah.

It would seem the Torah was written in 300 to 500 BC in Babylonian captivity.</p>
