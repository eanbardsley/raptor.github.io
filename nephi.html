<p> ET Contact or Extraordinarily Unlikely Coincidence</p>

<p>The odds that I would decide to point my camera to the sky in search of UFO’s and film something that I thought was a UFO but was a bat or a bug, and then report it to MUFON (The Mutual UFO Network) and receive a case number that would provoke me to look further into the matter (It provoked me because being case 67958 the consecutive integers that can be arranged 5, 6 , 7, 8, 9) was by very conservative estimates 1/1,000,000,000 (One in a billion).</p> 

<p>Then, that looking further panned out on my first guess, which was to look in the MUFON network files for case 56789, was a sighting in Utah, at 10:17 PM which I recognized not just that 10:17 was the time of the famous SETI Wow! Signal which was the one signal that years of listening for ET signals by SETI (Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence) was considered by scientist to be the one signal the at the earmarks of being ET, but that after looking at a map of Utah and finding that at the center of it was a city called Nephi, which means Nephilim, or Anunnaki, and is Hebrew for “Those who came from above” as explained by Zecharia Sitchin in his book The Twelfth Planet, that further reduces the odds of it being coincidence by another billion:</p>

<p>(1/1,000,000,000)(1/1,000,000,000)=1E18</p>

<p>But it didn’t stop there, Nephi was at the center of the UFO hotspots, Area 51, Roswell, …read on as we look at how MUFON, Nephi, Roswell, and Area 51 all come together in a cross with proportions of the golden ratio….</p>

<p> I herein relate the strange events that lead to an interesting discovery regarding Roswell and The Anunnaki.</p>

<p> It all started on the early evening of July 9, 2015 in Claremont, California.  I decided to begin looking for UFOs in hopes of capturing one on film.  I decided that the best way to begin was to just start filming the skies, chemtrails and airplanes. I stood in my backyard, in Claremont, California near the furthest reaching branches of the pine tree and pointed the camera nearly due west about 25 or 30 degrees high. As I was filming a chemtrail there, I noticed the brief appearance of a block spot.  I brought my camcorder into the house and downloaded the footage to my computer and found the spot, for which I removed a frame, and dropped it on my desktop for analysis. I thought it could best be described as a “black orb”, and I reported the image to MUFON (The Mutual UFO Network). To my amazement, the number assigned to my case was 67958. That is, my case was the sixty-seven thousand nine-hundred and fifty-eighth case to be reported. This amazed me because those digits could by arranged as the consecutive integers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  As a mathematician, I knew the odds of such assignment were of the odds of winning the lottery.</p>

<p> The Certificate For My Case, Case 67958</p>

<p> Case 56789 as it Appears in The MUFON Files</p>

<p> <img src="004.jpg" alt="004" width="700"></p>

<p> Interestingly, the event was preceded by a helicopter, which I had filmed in its appearance shortly before and, shortly after the sighting. When I reported my sighting to MUFON I found one of the questions they asked in the form I was filling out was if there were any helicopters accompanying the event, which they ask because UFO events often involve helicopters. I was able to answer yes:</p>

<p> <img src="005.jpg" alt="005" width="700"></p>

<p> I immediately decided that case 67958 being a long-shot number to receive, that whoever was assigned the case number 56789, the numbers for my case arranged in successive order, had experienced even a more unlikely occurrence than myself. Since MUFON makes their cases available to the public, I looked up that case number. It was at 10:17 PM in Utah.  As a person who has worked in astronomy, and is familiar with the famous SETI Wow Signal, I recognized that the time of sighting case number 56789 was at the same time. The SETI Wow signal was a signal intercepted by SETI (The Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence) that had all of the earmarks of being of non-human intelligent origins. I then looked at a map of Utah and to my amazement noticed that the center of that state was a city called Nephi. I knew that Nephi meant Nephilim, and, that Nephilim was Hebrew for Anunnaki  which translates as “those who came from above” in the Hebrew bible and Anuannaki being the beings spoken of in ancient Mesopotamian (Sumerian) Cuneiform clay tablets who the Sumerians said in these most ancient human writings, gave us mathematics, schools, government, and agriculture.</p>

<p> A day after I filmed the black orb, two sibling hawks appeared in the pine tree from near where I filmed it.<p/>

<p> <img src="007.jpg" alt="007" width="700"></p>

<p>The Ancient Sumerian cuneiform tablets speak of two siblings from another planet, Enki and Enlil, who were at odds with one another, in that Enki believed humans should be free and Enlil that they should remain enslaved. The story goes that Enki brought freedom to the Sumerians.</p>

<p> 
I next placed a star on a map at Claremont, where I filmed the black orb, and a star at Devils Tower in Wyoming, because that is where we first made contact with ETs in the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind. I also placed a star at Nephi, Utah and Area 51 in Nevada because it is believed that Area 51 is a secret base housing extraterrestrials and has a program where the U.S. government is back-engineering alien craft. I also placed a star at the center of Wyoming, which it would seem is the Arapahoe Indian Reservation. Finally, I place a star at Roswell, New Mexico where the famous UFO crash site was. These stars make a cross where Area 51 is a reflection about the Nephi central axis of Arapahoe and Claremont is a reflection about the Nephi central axis of Devils Tower. The Nephi Central Axis seems to point to our spacecraft launching headquarters in Houston, Texas (Mission Control) and Roswell is the foot of the cross. Map on next page,…</p>

<p> Here we see the top of the cross on the Oregon-Idaho border, calculated with the golden ratio, a place called Nyssa, in what is called Treasure Valley. and the central axis pointing more or less to mission control (Houston, Texas) in the red.</p>
